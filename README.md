# PowellOpt
Optimization algorithms by M.J.D. Powell

# About

This is a collection of optimization software by M.J.D. Powell.  The algorithms are:

* TOLMIN -- minimize a general differentiable nonlinear function subject to linear constraints.
* COBYLA (Constrained Optimization BY Linear Approximations)
* UOBYQA (Unconstrained Optimization BY Quadratic Approximation)
* NEWUOA (NEW Unconstrained Optimization Algorithm)
* BOBYQA (Bound Optimization BY Quadratic Approximation)
* LINCOA (LINearly Constrained Optimization Algorithm)

The routines are written in FORTRAN 77.
